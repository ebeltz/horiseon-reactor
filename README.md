# Horiseon Website Refactor Updates

## Updates
To make this website more accessible, I have made sure that all images have have alt attribute attached. I have also made sure that all headers attributes are in the correct order. The index.html file has HTML semantic elements. The website has a concise and descriptive title. Plus, all of the elements follow a logical structure. I consolidated the CSS file and added comments to help with the organization of the coding elements for the website.
